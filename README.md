This project is a personal exploration into the integration of AI technologies, specifically focused on working with models like Gemini from Google.The goal is to understand how artificial intelligence can be connected to real-world applications using modern APIs and tools. Through this project, I experiment with sending prompts, handling responses,andbuilding interactive features powered by AI. Itâ€™s part of my journey to learn how intelligent systems work under the hood and how developers can harnessthemtocreate smarter, more responsive software experiences.
